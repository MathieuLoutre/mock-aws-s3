# Mock AWS S3 SDK

This is a very simple interface that mocks the AWS SDK for Node.js.
It is very incomplete as it will mainly be used to test the grunt plugin `grunt-aws-s3`.
At the time of writing (although the tests pass), it may not be suitable for general use.

Available:
- listObjects
- deleteObjects
- deleteObject
- getObject
- putObject

It uses a directory to mock a bucket and its content.

If you'd like to see some more features or you have some suggestions, feel free to use the issues or submit a pull request.
